        <P> I Am a Student with great desires.Currently persuing my Bachelors from CMR INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY.
         I come from a conservative family which believe in Hardwork and Dedication.my biggest  inspirational people
        are my parents from whom I have learnt to be brave enough and consistent.Coming to my ambitions 
         my short term goal is to become a <i>Full Stack Developer</i>, and my long term goal is to become a <i>Entrepreneur</i>.
        Moreover my biggest strength is i have good <i>interpersonal skills</i> which helped me in keeping up responsibilities in my
        college.My weakness is im a overthinking person which i would like to overcome eventually.</P>
